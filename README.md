# Todos Code Test

## Requirements

You'll need to install NodeJS 8+ and MongoDB 4+

With a clean database, the start script will hydrate it with sample Todos.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install`

## Starting the server

```
npm start
```

The server will run on port 3000. You can change this by editing `config.dev.js` file.
